# ClusTr
I propose a new tree based clusterization method based on CART. I call it ClusTr (Clustering Tree). It has many similarities with CART algorithm and can be very useful in automatic cluster selection, visualization and speed. The algorithm grows a tree based on the within cluster variance minimization so it is by its essense similar Ward's method.
