# ClusTr algorithm
I propose a new tree based clusterization method called ClusTr (Clustering Tree). It has many similarities with the CART algorithm and can be very useful in automatic cluster selection and visualization. The algorithm grows a tree based on the within cluster variance minimization so it is by its essense similar Ward's method.
